                            The Commons is a community conspiring to proclaim
                            the cross, working to cultivate disciples, embracing
                            the oppressed, and inviting you to join the
                            movement.

                            Our History
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Commons (formerly Hope Church North Park) began
                            in 2011 with just a few people meeting in a living
                            room. We were passionate about Jesus and
                            passionate about seeing local, kingdom oriented,
                            churches planted. So, with the help and support
                            of another San Diego church that shared our
                            vision, we began meeting publicly in 2012.
                            Since then, we have continued to grow
                            by establishing Elders and baptizing new
                            disciples as we persist in serving our community
                            and inviting all to join God's movement.
                        </p>
                        <p class="header-text">
                            Why are we called The Commons?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was a mark of the church for people to hold their
                            lives and their possessions in common. We read one
                            examples of this in the book of Acts. There is even
                            this tradition within the history of the Church for
                            naming something for all people, a "common." (Common
                            Book of Prayer, Common Bible, Common Text of the
                            Church)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, we wanted to select a name for our
                            community that not only spoke to our mission, our
                            identity in Christ, but also one that had historical
                            significance.
                            Church)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For something to be "common" was not to be ordinary,
                            but to belong to the people. For something to be a
                            "commons" was to represent a common space or
                            resource that was of the people.
                            Church)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, our culture has lost the language and meaning
                            of a "commons." Physical space and common resources
                            are increasingly quantified and commercialized. We
                            might not call them "commons", yet, parks, beaches,
                            playgrounds, public utilities and public
                            transportation systems, libraries, museums, and
                            schools are all "commons."

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The church is a commons. The church is not a private
                            enterprise, but a public work. The church is the
                            Body of Christ, its work is to witness to the Cross,
                            and its worship is the work of the people. The
                            church is not a private good to be packaged and
                            sold. The church is not a commodity, or institution.
                            The church is collective, a band of natural enemies
                            not held together not by common race, education,
                            income, or politics. The church is a band of natural
                            enemies saved by Jesus, owing Jesus a common
                            allegiance.

                            Christ, his broken body and shed blood, is at the
                            center of all we do together. We gather because we
                            hold a common allegiance to Christ. We gather for
                            the common work of making Christ, His Cross, and His
                            Kingdom visible to all.
